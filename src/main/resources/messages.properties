instructions.text=Heroes of Cordan is a resource management game in the form of a text-based dungeon crawler. There are seven different resources: Time, Health, Physical, Arcane, Divine, Stealth, and Mechanical.\n- Many actions consume some amount of Time, and if it reaches 0, you lose.\n- Health represents the party's total health; if it drops to 0, you'll be forced to retreat and recover, which translates to a substantial loss of Time.\n\nThe other five resources represent your party's abilities and how they can overcome obstacles.\n- Physical represents combat ability, physical strength, and the ability to block attacks or traps.\n- Arcane is an offensive magical ability usually involving setting things on fire.\n- Divine magic is a defensive magical ability, the bane of undead and demons.\n- Stealth represents the ability to sneak, dodge, and spot trouble.\n- Mechanical is the ability to disarm traps, repair things, and deal with constructs.\n\nEach hero contributes some amount of these to the party's total of each resource, for instance, the Berzerker and Knight both contribute 5 Physical each. Each hero also has a Discount, lowering the amount of resources you have to spend in some situations. As you play, you'll encounter various obstacles, but you'll have the deicision of what resources to spend, and when to take the time to rest and recover them.\n\nAs you defeat monsters, you'll also gain Equipment (increasing the max of a particular resource) and Consumables (one-time-use items that increase the current value). As you get further in the game, you'll find better loot.\n\nAfter you defeat 10 monsters on each floor, you can fight the floor's boss. Beat the boss of floor 5 to win the game!\n\nAnd if you run out of time, don't get discouraged - learn from your mistakes, and try again. Next time, you'll do better!
