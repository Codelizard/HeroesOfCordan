# HeroesOfCordan
Heroes of Cordan is a single-player resource-management game where you take four brave and/or foolhardy adventurers and
venture into an ancient dungeon filled with traps, monsters, and loot of questionable value. Each action you take
matters, as you only have a set amount of time to get to the bottom of the dungeon!

HoC is a work in progress. It is 100% free.

Initially, HoC will only be available on Telegram, but there are plans to include additional platforms.
